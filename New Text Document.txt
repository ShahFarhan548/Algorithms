Search Algorithms:

    Binary Search:
                    In this kind of search algorithms the string or the 
                    element to be searched is located by continously dividing
                    the array by half , unless we are narrowed to the term.
    Naive String Search :
                    In this type of search algorithms we find a string inside 
                    a string by compairig it to the elements of the string one 
                    by one.

Sorting Algorithms:
    
    Bubble Sorting:
                    Bubble sort is a basic algorithm for arranging a string 
                    of numbers or other elements in the correct order. The
                    method works by examining each set of adjacent elements
                    in the string, from left to right,switching their positions
                    if they are out of order.
    
    Selection Sorting:
                    The selection sort algorithm sorts an array by repeatedly
                    finding the minimum element (considering ascending order)
                    from the unsorted part and putting it at the beginning. The 
                    algorithm maintains two subarrays in a given array. The 
                    subarray which already sorted.

    Insertion Sorting:
                    Insertion sort works similarly as we sort cards in our hand 
                    in a card game. We assume that the first card is already 
                    sorted then, we select an unsorted card. If the unsorted 
                    card is greater than the card in hand, it is placed on the 
                     =right otherwise, to the left.
